%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The preparation of the article is based on the standard llncs class
% (Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences), which is adjusted with style
% file of the conference.
%
% There are two ways of compilation of the file into PDF
% 1. Use pdfLaTeX (pdflatex), (LaTeX+DVIPS will not work);
% 2. Use LuaLaTeX (XeLaTeX will work too).
% When using LuaLaTeX You will need TTF or OTF CMU fonts
% (Computer Modern Unicode). The fonts are installed with 'cm-unicode' package in
% a distribution of LaTeX % (https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm-unicode),
% either by downloading and installing these fonts system wide, the address of their page is
% http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/%7Epanov/cm-unicode/
% The second option won't work in XeLaTeX.
%
% For MiKTeX (LaTeX distribution for Windows),
%  1. Package 'cm-unicode' is installed manually with the MiKTeX administration Console.
%  2. For the compilation of this example, namely, the stub figure, one will also need to
% download package 'pgf' manually. This package uses in the popular
% package tikz.
%  3. Tests showed that the rest of the required packages MiKTeX loads automatically (if
%     it is allowed). The 'auto download' option is
%     configured in 'Settings' section in MiKTeX Console.
%
%
% The easiest way to compile an article is to use pdfLaTeX, but
% the final layout of the book will be compiled with LuaLaTeX,
% as a result will be of better quality thanks to the package 'microtype' and
% use vector OTF instead of standard raster fonts of pdfLaTeX.
%
% In the case of questions and problems with the article compilation,
% write letters to e-mail: eugeneai@irnok.net, Cherkashin Evgeny.
%
% New version of the correcting style file will be available at the website:
%     https://github.com/eugeneai/nla-style
%     file - nla.sty
%
% Further instructions are in the text body of the template. The template itself
% is an article example.
%
% The LaTeX2e format is used!

% 12 points font size is used.
\documentclass[12pt]{llncs}

% The correcting style file is added.

\begin{abstract}
In this work, the complete set of tensor invariants of some classes of dynamic systems on the tangent bundles of a multidimensional
manifold is demonstrated. In this case, force fields are characterized by so-called variable dissipation
and generalize the earlier considered fields.

%\section{The main results}

In the problems of dynamics, mechanical systems
with many degrees of freedom with dissipation (position
space, multidimensional manifold) are studied.
The tangent bundles of these manifolds become their
phase spaces. Thus, for example, the study of an ndimensional
generalized spherical pendulum in a nonconservative
field of forces leads to a dynamic system
on the tangent bundles of an $(n-1)$-dimensional
sphere, and the metrics of special form on it are
induced by an additional group of symmetry \cite{1}, \cite{2}. In
this case, the dynamic systems describing the motion
of such a pendulum are characterized by alternating
dissipation, and the complete list of the first integrals
is composed of transcendental (in the sense of complex
analysis) functions, which can be expressed
through a finite combination of elementary functions.

Let us also define the class of problems about the
motion of a point over a multidimensional surface, the
metrics on which are induced by the Euclidian metrics
of the overall space. In some cases, it is also possible to
find the complete list of the first integrals composed of
transcendental functions in systems with dissipation.
The results obtained are especially important in the
sense of the presence of just a nonconservative field of
forces in a system.

In this work, the integrability of some classes of
dynamic systems on the tangent bundles of a multidimensional
manifold is demonstrated (for similar studies
on the tangent bundles of two-, three, and fourdimensional
manifolds, see \cite{3}, \cite{4}, \cite{5}). In this case, the force fields are characterized by so-called alternating
dissipation and generalize the fields considered earlier
(see also \cite{6}, \cite{7}).
